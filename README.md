# mixed-messages

## What Is?
Mixed Messages is a Codecademy Portfolio Project to generate a random message combining at least three data points. 

My project offers the user three quotes from fanatasy characters who might have some kind of useful advice.

## Usage
```
node main.js
```
## Contributing
Please feel free to add comments as I'm very open to constructive criticism. I'm also open to particular characters to add to the panel, or if there's a particularly good quote to add.
